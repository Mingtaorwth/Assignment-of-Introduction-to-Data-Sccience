## Introduction
You finally made it! Working as a data scientist at an established process mining company in New York, you earned so much money that you can buy a flat for yourself. You decide to buy a 2-room apartment in Manhattan. Congratulations!

Currently, you are still living in your rental apartment and are tied to a long-running rental contract. You can only use the apartment in 5 years from now. Therefore, you want to use the apartment as an AirBnB in the meantime, generating some consistent income. 

You have no clue how you should price your AirBnB per night (you are living in New York, so you never needed to book an AirBnB). You decide to leverage your unique skill set and perform a data-driven, informed decision. You collect all the data you can get your hands on by traversing all New York apartments. The retrieved data set **AirBnB_original.csv** is your starting point for investigation.

## [Installation](#installation)
